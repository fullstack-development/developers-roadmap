* What are the pros and cons of lazy evaluation? Provide some examples.
* What strategy used in Haskell?

  * Can you nest thunks?
  * Can thunks be recursive?
* What is the difference between call by value, call by name and call by need?
* What is WHNF?
* Are next expressions in WHNF or NF?

  * `1:2:3:[]`
  * `15`
  * `\x -> x * 2`
  * `(\x -> x + 1) 3`
* Can haskell evaluate in strict mode?
* Why strict functions in Haskell evaluate values to WHNF and not NF?
* What is the function `seq` (and operator `$!`)?
* What is the function `deepseq` (and operator `$!!`)?
* Could using `seq` change the returned value of the function?
* What is the GHC extension `BangPatterns`?
  * Make examples when bang pattern is useless.
  * Make examples when bang pattern has less power, than it could be supposed.
  * Show the difference between this two definitions:
    * `f1`

    ```haskell
    f1 x True = True
    f1 !x False = False
    ```

    * `f2`

    ```haskell
    f2 !x True = True
    f2 x False = False
    ```

  * Does bang patterns force execution, when they are nested in constructors inside of `let` or `where` expressions?
    * There is a `!` inside a `Maybe`, which is inside a `let` expression, and `let` expressions are lazy:

    ```haskell
    let (Just !a) = x in 1 + 1
    ```

* What are the GHC extensions `Strict` and `StrictData`?
